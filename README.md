# Grow-together
Seek for novel ways to introduce new tech, humanity, culture to kids 

## 【Background】:
This project comes from:
1) The frustration on current education scheme as well as related social trend in mainland China. In the recent years, most of parents / educators mainly focus on the performance of the national university entrance test ( Chinese name is "高考") , that has caused the kids dead-headly earned the high score, and spend less time on seeking for the dreams truely inspiring him/her to move on with the contribution to the society.
2) Inspiration by the notion and corresponding successful facts suggesting exploring different domains could help kids to find out his/her true career love as well as benefit the learning of other subjects.
3) Most of parents surrouding us actually are the experts or masters in their domains. They are good education resources, epecially they loves kids, and are equipped with rich life experience and domain expertise. They can bring best knowledge and skills to kids.

Thus, we decided to take the matter into our hands, and kicked off this initiative to try to move toward our original goals.
