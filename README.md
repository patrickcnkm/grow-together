# Grow-together
Seek for novel ways to introduce new tech, humanity, culture to kids 

## 【Background】:
This project comes from:
1) The frustration on current education scheme as well as related social trend in mainland China, which mainly focuses on the performance of the national university entrance test ( Chinese name is "高考") , that has caused the kids dead-headly earned the high score, and lack of inspiration to pursue his/her own dream or devote himself/herself to solve the big problems human kind is facing such as climate change, healthy, education, poverty, space exploration etc.
2) Inspiration by the notion and corresponding successful facts suggesting exploring different domains could help kids to find out his/her true career love as well as benefit the learning of other subjects.
3) Most of parents surrouding us actually are the experts or masters in their domains. They are good education resources, epecially they loves kids, and are equipped with rich life experience and domain expertise. They can bring best knowledge and skills to kids.

Thus, we decided to take the matter into our hands, and kicked off this initiative to try to move toward our original goals. 

## 【Purpose & Objectives】:

3) How can I proceed with further learnings / careers if I am interested in it?
